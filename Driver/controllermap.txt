Buttons 8U, 8D, 7U, 7D, 7R, and 7L are all currently unmapped (two will be used for whichever axis 1 is not used for, see ideas below)

move intake/launcher in reverse at 80

Ideas for buttons: 
    button used for changing launcher speed and arm movement modes (assuming the axis will control both)
    button pair used for increasing/decreasing launcher speed (assuming the launcher speed needs to be changeable)
    button pair used for moving the arm up or down (assuming this will not be done on a joystick)
